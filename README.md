# Deep-Lesion
A deep learning framework for detecting lesions in CT scans from Deep Lesion dataset


To convert Pascal VOC annotations to COCO dataset format,
run generate_xml_list.py to generate a text file containing a list of all the .xml files in the annotation folder
run voc2coco.py to generate a single .json file 


Our pytorch implementations of PANet and EncoderNet are present in panet.py .
